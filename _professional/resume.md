cause.
  * Implemented cross-process and cross-thread communication logic to perform
interoperability between legacy applications and a new application.
  * Worked effectively with other developers to solve cross-platform (Windows/Linux)
porting issues.
  * Secured a reputation as a motivated problem solver by providing second-level
customer support.
  * Aggressively pursued advancement of other developers, by providing training in TDD
and ASim project integration, and by organizing training from external consultants.

  * Maintained and enhanced an iterative algorithm to solve complex train routing
scenarios.

**Teaching Experience:**

* Part-time Faculty ~ Grove City College ~ January 2014 - February
2014
  * Designed and delivered a six-week course on development of concurrent software
using C++.
  * Focused on basic tools for concurrency: threads, mutexes, condition variables, and
atomics.
  * Provided guidelines for design of concurrent software, with an emphasis on Amdahl’s
law.
  * Exposed students to TDD as a means of code construction.
  * Hosted the course content on Github
(github.com/joshpeterson/DevelopingConcurrentSoftware).

**Master's Thesis:**

* A Complete Characterization of Nash Solutions in Ordinal Games ~ April 2005
  * Developed a representation of the infinite space of two-player games which allows
these games to be considered as a part of a simplified finite space.

**Publication:**

* J.M. Peterson and M. A. Simaan, “Probabilities of Pure Nash Equilibria in Matrix
Games When the Payoff Entries of One Player are Randomly Selected,” Journal of
