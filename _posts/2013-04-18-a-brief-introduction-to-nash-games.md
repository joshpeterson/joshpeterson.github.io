title: A brief introduction to Nash games
---

Nash games describe a branch of game theory where two evenly matched players compete to each minimize an objective function by choosing from a fixed set of input values.

Suppose Player 1 has one control variable $$x$$, which can take on values or $$x_1$$, $$x_2$$, or $$x_3$$. Likewise Player 2 has one control variable $$y$$, which can take on values $$y_1$$, $$y_2$$, or $$y_3$$. The objective functions for players 1 and 2 are $$J_1$$ and $$J_2$$, respectively. The bimatrix game below shows the values of the objective functions for each combination of $$x_i$$, $$y_i$$.

$$J_1(x_1,y_1) = 5.3$$
$$J_2(x_1,y_1) = 7.8$$
