title: More fun with coin flipping
---
In my [last post](fun-with-coin-flipping/) I attempted to solve three coin flipping [puzzles](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2013/11/169037-puzzled-coin-flipping/abstract) using Monte Carlo simulation. The [solutions](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2013/12/169936-puzzled-solutions-and-sources/abstract) to the puzzles are published, so I'll compare my results to the correct analytic solutions.
