title: A brief introduction to syllogisms
---
Arguments can be very productive. If you and I have a framework to argue without making personal attacks, the argument can be something like a science experiment for ideas. I might propose a theory, and you might test it, eventually disproving it. The syllogism us one framework for arguments which I often find useful.

What is a syllogism?
===================
A syllogism consists of two or more statements, connected by a logical argument, which implies a conclusion. If

* The definitions of the terms are clear, and
* The premises are true, and
* The logic is valid

Then we must agree on the conclusion.

[Socratic Logic](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1587318083?ie=UTF8&force-full-site=1&ref_=aw_bottom_links) is an excellent book by Peter Kreeft on the subject.

The canonical syllogism
====================
To demonstrate the rules described above, let's look at a simple example.

All men are mortal.
Socrates is a man.
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

This syllogism has three terms.

* Man/men: a male human person
* Mortal: a state of existence in which on will die
* Socrates: the ancient Greek philosopher

This syllogism has two premises.

* Major (universal) premise: All men are mortal.
* Minor (specific) premise: Socrates is a man.
