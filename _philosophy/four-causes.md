title: The Four Causes
---
How can we determine why something occurs? This is a summary of the four causes
proposed by Aristotle to answer the "why" question. A more detailed exploration is
available in the [Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/).

For Aristotle, every change has a cause. He saw four different kinds of causes for any change:

* **Material cause**
  * "That out of which"
  * The _input_ for the change
* **Formal cause**
  * "The account of what-it-is-to-be"
  * The _final form_ the of the result of the change
* **Efficient case**
  * "The primary source of the change"
  * The _actor_ which makes the change happen
* **Final cause**
  * "The end"
  * The _reason_ why the change takes place
