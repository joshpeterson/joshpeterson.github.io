How does St. Thomas Aquinas understand eternity? Does it mean something more than
just "forever"? Is it still related to time?

In the tenth question of the Summa, St. Thomas addresses [The Eternity of
God](http://summaexplorer.herokuapp.com/questions/10). He uses five articles to take us
from the definition of eternity, to its application in God, to finally its
relationship with time.

## The definition of eternity

Not surprisingly, St. Thomas starts with a
[definition](http://summaexplorer.herokuapp.com/articles/45) of eternity. He intends to
use the interesting definition from Boethius, and then defends his choice of this
definition. Although this definition is a bit long and complex, it pays off in the
end, as a clear definition makes the answers to some complex questions my simpler.

In [Book 5](http://www.san.beck.org/Boethius5.html) of "The Consolation of
Philosophy" Boethius defines eternity like this:
> ... eternity is at once the total and perfect possession of interminable life...

St. Thomas modifies the definition slightly from this translation, using this
definition:
> The simultaneously-whole and perfect possession of interminable life.

The change does not seem to be significant though. It may just be due to a
difference in translation. 

### Important terms

To explain his definition, St. Thomas uses a few words which might seem to have odd
meanings to us:

 * **Simple:**  Here simple does not mean unintelligent, but rather, it is the
   opposite of compound. St. Thomas spends [question
   3](http://summaexplorer.herokuapp.com/questions/3) discussing the simplicity of God.
   From that we can better understand what he means by "simple". Something which is
   simple:

   1. Does not have distinct parts we can count
   2. Does not have matter and form
   3. Does not have subject and accident

   These attributes are a few among others listed in the article ["Whether God is
   altogether simple?"](http://summaexplorer.herokuapp.com/articles/20). Simple
   represents some kind of wholeness and consistency. For St. Thomas, God is
   simple, almost everything else is not.

 * **Compound**: Compound means the opposite of simple. Anything which has distinct
   parts is compound. So most things we experience with our senses are compound.

   I find the use of the words simple and compound in this way difficult to follow;
   in my mind simple tends to mean "easy to understand" and compound often means
   "difficult to understand".  St. Thomas, however, views simple in compound in the
   opposite way:
   > we attain to the knowledge of simple things by way of compound things

   This is important to keep in mind as we go forward.

 * **Movement**: We tend to think of movement as a change in position, like when we
   walk from one place to another. For St. Thomas, movement is more general,
   meaning any kind of change.
   > a thing bereft of movement, which is always the same

   For example, arithmetic has no movement: the fact `1 + 1 = 2` will never change.
   If I apply arithmetic to something physical - say I have one cookie and another
   cookie, then I eat them both - now I have changed, and movement has occurred.

### Two parts of the definition

With a better understanding of these words in mind, we can see now how St. Thomas
addresses the two parts of this definition (although in the reverse order they
appear).

* Time is the numbering of change (movement) with words like before and after.
* If something does not change (e.g. `1 + 1 = 2`), then we don't say is has any
  before or after.
* We say this thing which does not change is eternal.

So eternal things live in the opposite of time.  Eternity is the way we express the
immutability of things that do not change. These things which do not change do not
start or terminate, so we call them _interminable_.

In addition, something which does not have a beginning and an end as no
_succession_, meaning we cannot number its changes. For example, the life of of a
person has succession: they are baby, then a child, then an adult. An arithmetic
fact like `1 + 1 = 2` does not.

Finally, since `1 + 1 = 2` never gets more or less "arithmeticy" then we can say
that it always a _whole_ arithmetic fact. St. Thomas uses the work simultaneously
to mean always.

So the two parts of the definition are then:

1. Something that does not have a beginning or an end is called _interminable_.
2. Something that has no succession is _simultaneously-whole_.

Since we use both of these concepts to describe eternity, we say that eternity is
the _simultaneously-whole and perfect possession of interminable life_. I read this
as "eternity is the name for existence without beginning or end where everything is
as full and perfect as it can be."

## How does eternity differ from time?

It might be appealing to consider eternity to be time without beginning or end. But
St. Thomas [explains](http://summaexplorer.herokuapp.com/articles/48) that this is not
really a proper analogy. Indeed some believe that time will not end, so how can it
differ from eternity? The definition above provides a succinct answer to this
question:

> eternity is the measure of a permanent being; while time is a measure of movement

In addition, we regularly speak about different parts of time, like the beginning
and end of each day. Since eternity is simultaneously whole, it does not have
different parts, and is therefore different from time.

## How does eternity apply to God?

Recall from the definition above that St. Thomas uses the word "movement" in the
same sense we use the word "change". Recall that

* Time is the measure of movement (change)
* Eternity is the measure of immutability

[God is immutable](http://summaexplorer.herokuapp.com/articles/44), therefore God is eternal.
